    "## Final Exercise Day 1: Putting It All Together\n",
    "Now that we have covered the basics of Python programming and essential data structures, let's put everything into practice with a final exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "You are working on a CRM system and need to manage and process customer data. You have a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains details about a customer. Your task is to perform various operations to manipulate and retrieve customer data using the concepts you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "1. Create a list of dictionaries called `customers`, where each dictionary contains the keys \"name\", \"title\", and \"email\" with appropriate values.\n",
    "2. Use a `for` loop to print the names and titles of all customers.\n",
    "3. Add a new customer to the `customers` list.\n",
    "4. Update the email address of a specific customer.\n",
    "5. Remove a customer from the list.\n",
    "6. Use an `if-elif-else` statement to categorize the customers based on their titles and print the appropriate message:\n",
    "    - If the title is \"Account Executive\", print \"Handles client accounts.\"\n",
    "    - If the title is \"Sales Manager\", print \"Manages the sales team.\"\n",
    "    - If the title is \"Customer Success Manager\", print \"Ensures customer satisfaction.\"\n",
    "    - Otherwise, print \"Title not recognized.\"\n",
    "7. Use a `while` loop to keep adding dummy sales data to a customer until their sales reach a certain target. Print the updated sales after each addition.\n"
